# SORTING ALGORITHMS
Sorting of algorithms is an important feat in software engineering, because of the complexity.

Some of the covered algorithms in this project are:
- bubble sort
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- quick sort

among many others...

## BIG O NOTATION
Time complexity is a very important factor with algorithms design as it determines
the time needed for a program to be executed.

Big O notation is the most used used convention to represent the speed of execution of 
an algotithms.

*common big O notation are listed below:*
- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n^2)
- O(log(n)
